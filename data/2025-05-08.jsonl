Advances in detection technology have led to an exponential\ngrowth in data, necessitating innovative and efficient analysis methods. This\nproblem is exacerbated by the large variety of possible forms an\nextraterrestrial signal might take, and the size of the multidimensional\nparameter space that must be searched. It is then made markedly worse by the\nfact that our best guess at the properties of such a signal is that it might\nresemble the signals emitted by human technology and communications, the main\n(yet diverse) contaminant in radio observations. We address this challenge by\nusing a combination of simulations and machine learning methods for anomaly\ndetection. We rank candidates by how unusual they are in frequency, and how\npersistent they are in time, by measuring the similarity between consecutive\nspectrograms of the same star. We validate that our filters significantly\nimprove the quality of the candidates that are selected for human vetting when\ncompared to a random selection. Of the ~ 10^11 spectrograms that we analyzed,\nwe visually inspected thousands of the most promising spectrograms, and\nthousands more for validation, about 20,000 in total, and report that no\ncandidate survived basic scrutiny."}

Each sub-exposure is expected to show small\ndifferences in the positions of stars and other objects in the field, due to\nthe movement of the celestial bodies, changes/imperfections in the\nopto-mechanical imaging train, and other factors. To maximize image quality,\none must ensure that each sub-exposure is aligned to a common frame of\nreference prior to stacking. This is done by reprojecting each exposure onto a\ncommon target grid defined using a World Coordinate System (WCS) that is\ndefined by mapping the known angular positions of reference objects to their\nobserved spatial positions on each image. The transformations needed to\nreproject images involve complicated trigonometric expressions which can be\nslow to compute, so reprojection can be a major bottleneck in image processing\npipelines.\n  To make astronomical reprojections faster to implement in pipelines, we have\nwritten `dfreproject`, a Python package of GPU-optimized functions for this\npurpose. The package's functions break down coordinate transformations using\nGnomonic projections to define pixel-by-pixel shifts from the source to the\ntarget plane. The package also provides tools for interpolating a source image\nonto a target plane with a single function call. This module follows the FITS\nand SIP formats laid out in the seminal papers. Compared to common\nalternatives, `dfreproject`'s routines result in speedups of up to 20X when run\non a GPU and 10X when run on a CPU."}

Such inverse problems typically involve large uncertainties, both in\nthe measurement parameters being inverted and in the underlying physics models\nthemselves.

In this position paper, we\nadvocate adopting a hybrid approach that leverages our recent advances in the\ndevelopment of formal verification methods for numerical algorithms, with the\ngoal of constructing parameter space restrictions with provable mathematical\nand physical correctness properties, whilst nevertheless respecting both\nexperimental uncertainties and uncertainties in the underlying physical\nprocesses."}

They\nsimulated detections via spectral cross-correlation applied to high resolution\noptical and near-IR transit spectroscopy using the ELTs. Currie et al. did not\nconsider the effect of unocculted star spots, but we do that here for possible\ndetections of molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor. We\nfind that confusion noise from unocculted star spots becomes significant for\nlarge programs that stack tens to hundreds of transits to detect these\nmolecules. Noise from star spots increases with greater spot filling factors,\nand star spot temperature has less effect than filling factor. Nevertheless,\nmolecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane could be detected in temperate\nrocky planets transiting nearby M-dwarfs without correcting for star spots.\nWater vapor detections are the most affected, with star spots contaminating the\nexoplanet signal as well as producing extra noise. Unocculted spots only affect\ntransit spectroscopy when normalizing by dividing by the total flux from the\nstar. We describe an alternate normalization method that minimizes star spot\neffects by deriving and implementing an unspotted proxy spectrum for the\nnormalization. We show that the method works in principle using realistic\nlevels of random observational noise. Alternate normalization would be broadly\napplicable to all types of transit spectroscopy, and we discuss challenges to\napplying it in practice. We also outline a comprehensive approach that has the\npotential to overcome those challenges."}

Due to their large free streaming lengths,\nneutrinos significantly influence the formation of cosmic structures at\nnon-linear scales. To maximize the information yield from current and future\ngalaxy surveys, it is essential to generate precise theoretical predictions of\nstructure formation. One approach to achieve this is by running large sets of\ncosmological numerical simulations, which is a computationally intensive\nprocess. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) model to emulate the Universe for a variety of neutrino masses.\nOur model called $\\nu$GAN (for neutrino GAN) is able to generate 2D cosmic webs\nof the Universe for a number of neutrino masses ranging from 0.0 eV to 0.4 eV.\nThe generated maps exhibit statistical independence, lack correlations with\ntraining data, and very closely resemble the distribution of matter in true\nmaps. We assess the accuracy of our results both visually and through key\nstatistics used in cosmology and computer vision analyses. Our results indicate\nthat samples generated by $\\nu$GAN are accurate within a 5% error on power\nspectrum between k=0.01 to k=0.5 h/Mpc. Although this accuracy covers the\nmildly non-linear scales, consistent with other works and observations,\nachieving higher accuracy at fully non-linear scales requires more\nsophisticated models, such as diffusion models. Nevertheless, our work opens up\nnew avenues for building emulators to generate fast and massive neutrino\nsimulations, potentially revolutionizing cosmological predictions and analyses.\nThis work serves as a proof-of-concept, paving the way for future extensions\nwith higher-resolution 3D data and advanced generative models."}

However, Sonora\nElf Owl did not accurately estimate CO$_2$ quenching because the models\nquenched the gas with respect to the full atmosphere equilibrium, but CO$_2$\nshould have instead been quenched with respect to the disequilibrium (i.e.,\nquenched) abundance of CO. As a result, Sonora Elf Owl under-predicted the\nCO$_2$ abundance by several order of magnitude in some instances, an amount\nthat JWST is sensitive to.

Machine\nlearning, which has already been successfully applied to the classification of\nvariable stars based on light curves, offers another possibility for the\nautomatic detection of HBSs. We propose a novel feature extraction approach for\nHBSs. First, the light curve is transformed into the frequency domain via\nFourier transform, then the amplitudes of the first 100 harmonics are\nextracted, and finally these harmonics are normalised as feature vectors of the\nlight curve. A training data set of synthetic light curves is constructed using\nELLC, and their features are fed into recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for\nsupervised learning, with the expected output being the eccentricity of these\nlight curves. The performance of RNNs is evaluated using a test data set of\nsynthetic light curves, achieving 95$\\%$ accuracy. When applied to known HBSs\nfrom OGLE, Kepler, and TESS surveys, the networks achieve an average accuracy\nof 88$\\%$. This method successfully identify four new HBSs within the eclipsing\nbinary catalog of Kirk et al. The use of orbital harmonics as features for HBSs\nproves to be an effective approach that significantly reduces the computational\ncost of neural networks. RNNs show excellent performance in recognising this\ntype of time series data.

Since\nthen, its atmosphere has been investigated using multiple telescopes and\ninstruments. However, many of its atmospheric constraints remain debatable.\nWhile HST observations suggested a highly sub-solar metallicity, recent JWST\nNIRCam observations by Xue et al. 2024 constrained a super-solar metallicity\nwith highly sub-solar C/O. In this work, we show a detailed investigation of HD\n209458 b transmission spectra observations from JWST and HST using SANSAR, a\nnewly developed planetary atmosphere modeling framework, with free, equilibrium\nchemistry and self-consistent grid retrievals. The overall best-fitting model\nwith free retrievals ($\\chi^2_{\\rm{red}}$=1.21) constrains its metallicity and\nC/O to be highly sub-solar, while equilibrium chemistry and grid retrievals\n($\\chi^2_{\\rm{red}}$=1.27 and 1.30, respectively) are consistent with solar\nvalues using STIS+WFC3+NIRCam observations. The retrieved abundances of H$_2$O\nand CO$_2$ are almost three orders of magnitude lower (highly sub-solar) with\nSTIS+WFC3+NIRCam compared to just NIRCam, using free retrievals. NIRCam\nobservations alone also result in misleading constraints on metallicity and\nC/O, with equilibrium chemistry and grid retrieval. We find that the model\nchoice of varying C/H or O/H to vary the C/O in equilibrium chemistry\nretrievals leads to different metallicity constraints with NIRCam, but similar\nconstraints with STIS+WFC3+NIRCam. We conclude that NIRCam observations alone\ncan lead to overestimation of abundances for exoplanet atmospheres and,\ntherefore, should be used in combination with UV/Optical and near-infrared\nobservations to obtain robust constraints on abundances, C/O, and metallicity.\nSpecifically, even though we can detect the CO$_2$ feature with just NIRCam, we\ncannot constrain its abundances robustly without the optical baseline."}

Multiple ZDI inversions have been conducted for the early B-type\nstar tau Sco, which has been found to exhibit a weak but complex non-dipolar\nsurface magnetic field. The classical ZDI framework suffers from a significant\nlimitation in that it provides little to no reliable uncertainty quantification\nfor the reconstructed magnetic field maps, with essentially all published\nresults being confined to point estimates. To fill this gap, we propose a\nBayesian framework for probabilistic ZDI. Here, the proposed framework is\ndemonstrated on tau Sco in the weak-field limit. We propose three distinct\nstatistical models, and use archival ESPaDOnS high-resolution Stokes V\nobservations to carry out the probabilistic magnetic inversion in closed form.\nThe surface magnetic field is parameterised by a high-dimensional\nspherical-harmonic expansion. By comparing three different prior distributions\nover the latent variables in the spherical-harmonic decomposition, our results\nshowcase the ZDI sensitivity to various hyperparameters.
